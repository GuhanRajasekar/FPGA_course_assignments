x -> 10 bits for the integer part and 10 bits for the fractional part
y -> 10 bits for the integer part and 10 bits for the fractional part
z -> 10 bits for the integer part and 10 bits for the fractional part

z converges to (y/x) after 10 - 12 iterations
CORDIC division can lie only in the range of [-2,2]
